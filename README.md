# C++ Learning Journey

This repository contains my progress learning C++ concepts, organized by topic with CMake build system.

## Structure

```
cpp-learning/
├── concepts/
│   ├── 00_Core/
|   |  └── Arrays/
|   |  └── ...
|   ├── 01_OOP/
│   └── ...
└── CMakeLists.txt
```

## Building with CMake

### Using Visual Studio
1. Open Visual Studio
2. File → Open → Folder
3. Select the `cpp-learning` directory
4. Visual Studio will automatically configure CMake
5. Use Build → Build All or Ctrl+Shift+B

### Using Command Line
```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
cmake --build .
```
